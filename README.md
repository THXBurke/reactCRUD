Write  a single resource CRUD client app using a framework other Angular. You can choose to back this with a database that you create or have it interact with an api on the web, whatever makes sense for the framework but it should some form of data persistence. You don't have to write tests but if you can test it, you'll get a bonus point. Feel free to work with small group or by yourself. Submit a link to your repository, no need for a pull request. Write a short paragraph in your submission about the differences between the framework you chose and Angular.
